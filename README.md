<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## :question: About The Project :question:
<hr>

The need is about renting houses or rooms in Nicaragua. This is based on the local migration that the country maintains. 

Most of the citizens move to live in the capital of the country, therefore, there are people who start the service of renting rooms or houses. The only way you can work this is by using pieces of cardboard that has written "for rent" or "for rent a room."

To get a contact to offer this service, it was necessary that this was an acquaintance of a family member or friend. 
The existence of an application that can show different houses or rooms will help to find an accommodation site more quickly.

The search for temporary accommodation is common among Nicaraguan youth, this is because many of them come from apartments and tend to move to the capital and depend on renting a room. In the case of being a group of friends who move at the same time, it is possible to rent a house instead of each one renting a room.

Essentially, **RentApp** it's a `Rent-A-House App` (you don't say...).
